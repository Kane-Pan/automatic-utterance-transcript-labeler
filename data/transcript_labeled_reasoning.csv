0,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,5.94,6.26,Yeah.,,"This utterance, ""Yeah."", shows minimal thought and can often be used as a backchanneling cue or acknowledgement in conversation. It does not provide any new information or show adaptation to the current situation or context. Therefore, this utterance can be classified as ""Automatic""."
1,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,6.04,7.65,Yeah. Hey can you hear me?,Yeah.,"This utterance, ""Yeah. Hey can you hear me?"", appears to be a combination of both automatic and reflective elements. The initial ""Yeah"" is an automatic response, serving as backchanneling cue and possibly sounding rehearsed or robotic. However, the subsequent phrase, ""Hey can you hear me?"" indicates thoughtfulness and on-the-fly thinking in addressing potential communication issues within the conversation, making it a reflective utterance.

Final answer: Reflective."
2,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,7.54,9.25,"Yeah, I can hear you. How are you?",Yeah. Hey can you hear me?,"This utterance ""Yeah, I can hear you. How are you?"" can be classified as ""Automatic"". The response is a typical backchannel cue and a common greeting that does not rely on any unique context, making it an automatic response."
3,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,9.44,10.76,"Good thanks, how are you?","Yeah, I can hear you. How are you?","The current utterance, ""Good thanks, how are you?"", is a common social opening or greeting that does not rely on any unique context. It sounds robotic and rehearsed, as if following a script, which aligns with the characteristics of an Automatic utterance. Therefore, I would classify this utterance as ""Automatic""."
4,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,10.74,12.66,Good. Yeah.,"Good thanks, how are you?","The current utterance ""Good. Yeah."" shows scripted or rehearsed behavior, as it is a common social response to the question ""How are you?"" This utterance does not show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation, nor does it refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment. It falls under the category of lone backchanneling cues and closed questions asking for mundane things unrelated to the speaker, making it an ""Automatic"" response."
5,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,12.34,14.64,Um,Good. Yeah.,"Based on the provided definitions and the utterance presented, I would classify this as an ""Automatic"" response. The word ""Um"" is often used as a backchanneling cue, indicating that the speaker is considering their next thought or action. In this case, it does not show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation, and it is a single word with no unique contextual reference, making it more likely to be categorized as an automatic utterance."
6,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,13.71,15.04,"During,",Um,"Based on the definitions provided, the current utterance ""During,"" does not show any clear signs of being scripted or thoughtful as it appears to be a response to the lone backchanneling cue (""Um"") from the previous speaker. It can also be seen as a filler word, which is common in automatic speech. Therefore, I would classify this utterance as ""Automatic""."
7,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,14.65,15.36,What?,"During,","The current utterance ""What?"" shows scripted behavior, specifically a backchannel cue, as it is used to signal understanding or attention during conversation. This falls under the category of Automatic utterances.

Automatic"
8,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,15.74,17.15,how are you doing this weekend?,What?,"The current utterance, ""How are you doing this weekend?"", appears thoughtful and invites a response. It is asking about the other person's state, which is a personal question that can provide new information and invite elaboration. Therefore, I would classify it as ""Reflective""."
9,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,17.64,24.36,Yeah I'm doing pretty good. Um It's still it's still friday for me. Is it saturday for you?,how are you doing this weekend?,Classification: Automatic

Is it saturday for you?,"The current utterance ""It's friday. Yeah. Oh my weekend"" can be classified as Automatic. This response is somewhat robotic, follows a simple pattern (""[day of the week]. [Affirmation.] [Phrase relating to the day]""), and does not provide unique context or personal information, making it an automatic utterance."
11,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,25.74,25.94,Yeah.,It's friday. Yeah. Oh my weekend,"The current utterance, ""Yeah."", can be classified as ""Automatic"". This response is a common backchannel cue, sounding rehearsed or following a pattern of agreement in conversation without adding unique context or thoughtful information to the discussion."
12,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,26.01,28.05,starts early because I don't work on Fridays.,Yeah.,"The current utterance shows thoughtful behavior, as it responds to the context of the conversation (the fact that the previous speaker confirmed something) and provides unique details about the speaker's schedule. It does not sound robotic or rehearsed, and it is not a common social opening/greeting/answer that does not rely on any unique context. Therefore, this utterance can be classified as ""Reflective""."
13,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,28.34,28.88,Okay.,starts early because I don't work on Fridays.,"The current utterance ""Okay."" can be classified as Automatic. This utterance does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation, and it does not refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment. Instead, it is a simple acknowledgement that could potentially sound robotic or rehearsed. It does not ask any questions or add new information to invite elaboration, making it more likely to be classified as Automatic.

So, the label for this utterance is ""Automatic""."
14,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,28.44,30.56,I would love to someday. So. Yeah.,Okay.,"Analysis: The current utterance shows scripted behavior, as it appears rehearsed or lacking thoughtful adaptation in response to the previous statement (""Okay."") made by the other speaker.

Comparison: This utterance resembles automatic utterances due to the presence of lone backchanneling cues (e.g., ""Yeah"") and closed questions that ask for mundane things unrelated to the speaker or context (e.g., ""So.""). It does not show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation.

Decision: Based on the analysis and comparison of features, this utterance can be classified as ""Automatic"".

Label: Automatic"
15,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,30.54,30.95,Yeah,I would love to someday. So. Yeah.,"Analysis: The current utterance ""Yeah"" does not show any on-the-fly thinking, adaptation or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation. It is a simple backchanneling cue that can be seen as robotic or rehearsed and could be considered following a script in some contexts. Therefore, it fits best with the definition of ""Automatic"".

Label: Automatic"
16,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,31.14,31.55,Yeah.,Yeah,"Analyzing the current utterance, it shows repetition of the backchanneling cue ""Yeah,"" which is a characteristic of Automatic utterances. This response does not show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation. Therefore, the label for this utterance is ""Automatic""."
17,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,31.34,33.36,it's not actually um,Yeah.,"This utterance, ""it's not actually um,"" is classified as ""Reflective"". The speaker appears to be reflecting on the previous statement and providing a counterpoint or clarification, which indicates thoughtful behavior in response to the context of the conversation."
18,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,33.14,33.76,Yeah.,it's not actually um,"Based on the provided definitions, the given utterance ""Yeah."" appears to be an Automatic response. This utterance sounds robotic or rehearsed and is a backchanneling cue that does not rely on any unique context of the conversation. It acknowledges the previous speaker's statement but doesn't add new information or show thoughtful behavior. So, the label for this utterance would be ""Automatic""."
19,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,33.37,36.66,you get a day off when everyone else is still working.,Yeah.,"I have analyzed the current utterance, and here's my classification based on the provided steps:

1. The current utterance appears to show thoughtful behavior as it does not sound rehearsed or scripted, but rather a response to the previous statement.
2. Comparing this utterance with the definitions provided:
   - It does not include common greetings/answers, lone backchanneling cues, closed questions, or statements that do not rely on any unique context. This points towards it not being an Automatic utterance.
   - Instead, it refers to a unique detail in response to the context of the conversation (the other person mentioning they are working), which is characteristic of Reflective utterances.
3. Given the analysis above, I decide that the label ""Reflective"" fits best for this utterance.
4. ""Reflective"""
20,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,36.64,42.37,Right. I think it's nice to people to do things without people are out and about. So like,you get a day off when everyone else is still working.,"This current utterance shows on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, and acknowledgement to the other person or current situation. It refers to unique details in response to the context of the conversation by agreeing with the previous statement and expressing a personal opinion about enjoying doing things when fewer people are around. Therefore, this utterance can be classified as ""Reflective""."
21,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,41.94,42.44,Yeah.,Right. I think it's nice to people to do things without people are out and about. So like,"This utterance, ""Yeah."", is an example of Automatic response. It does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation, as it is a simple backchanneling cue that does not contribute new information to the conversation. Additionally, it is not asking for elaboration nor does it refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment. It is more likely that this utterance is used in agreement or acknowledgement of the previous speaker's statement, rather than expressing personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences. Therefore, I classify this current utterance as ""Automatic."""
22,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,42.38,43.36,days. Good,Yeah.,"I have analyzed the current utterance and compared its features against the definitions of Automatic and Reflective. The current utterance does not sound robotic or rehearsed, as it is a simple acknowledgement to the previous statement. However, it doesn't show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or the current situation, nor does it refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment. It is also not asking open-ended questions or adding new information to invite elaboration, and it is not asking personal questions to learn about the other person. Instead, it is expressing a brief sentiment that could be considered a backchannel cue but is not common social opening/greeting/answer, making it somewhat different from typical lone backchanneling cues.

Given these observations, I classify this utterance as ""Automatic""."
23,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,43.84,44.21,Yeah,days. Good,"The current utterance ""Yeah"" can be classified as Automatic. This response sounds like a backchanneling cue, which is common in conversational exchanges, but does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation that would indicate reflective behavior. It also does not provide new information or refer to unique details in the context of the conversation, making it more robotic and less thoughtful compared to a reflective utterance. So, in this case, the label is ""Automatic""."
24,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,43.94,44.89,one,Yeah,"Based on the given context and definitions, this utterance can be classified as ""Automatic"". Here's why:

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The utterance ""one"" seems to lack a meaningful connection or thoughtful response to the previous utterance of ""Yeah"". It does not appear to be a deliberate or reflective statement, but rather a disconnected numerical value, which suggests a more automatic or rehearsed response.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: The utterance ""one"" falls under the category of lone backchanneling cues in the definition for Automatic utterances. It does not display on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation; it also lacks a unique contextual reference and does not invite elaboration or add new information to the conversation.

3. Decide which label fits best: Given the lack of meaningful connection, uniqueness in context, or thoughtful response, the label ""Automatic"" is the appropriate choice for this utterance.

4. End every response with the label: ""Automatic""."
25,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,44.22,44.65,sure.,one,"Based on the provided definition and the current utterance, I would classify this as an ""Automatic"" response. The utterance ""Sure."" does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation to the other person or current situation. It is a common word used as an acknowledgement or agreement, and it does not refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment. It appears to be a simple, automatic response, rather than a reflective one that would involve personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences, or open-ended questions or added information to invite elaboration."
26,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,44.89,47.45,really is out and about now,sure.,"This utterance, ""really is out and about now,"" appears to show on-the-fly thinking, adapting to the context of the conversation. The speaker seems to be commenting on the current situation or environment, making it a response that is unique to the context of the conversation. Therefore, this utterance can be classified as ""Reflective""."
27,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,47.34,49.44,Yeah but,really is out and about now,"This utterance, ""Yeah but,"" can be classified as ""Automatic."" It is a backchanneling cue that does not require thoughtful consideration or adaptation to the current context. It simply acknowledges the previous statement while indicating disagreement or contradiction. The response does not provide any unique details, open-ended questions, personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences that would classify it as reflective."
28,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,48.64,49.56,in this time.,Yeah but,"I have analyzed the provided utterance, and based on the defined characteristics for Automatic and Reflective utterances, I will classify it as follows:

1. The utterance does not show either scripted or thoughtful behavior, as it is a short, simple response with no obvious indication of being rehearsed or following a specific pattern.
2. Comparing the features, this utterance does not sound robotic or rehearsed (it's not Automatic), but it also doesn't show any signs of on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation (it's not Reflective).
3. Since the utterance lacks the characteristics of both Automatic and Reflective categories, I find it hard to definitively classify it under either label based solely on the given information. However, since it does seem more akin to a possible continuation or response in conversation rather than a scripted phrase (which are often more closed), I would tentatively lean towards the Reflective classification.
4. Given my analysis and leaning towards the Reflective category, the utterance can be labeled as ""Reflective."""

It is a backchanneling cue, a response that indicates the listener is paying attention without interrupting the speaker or providing additional information. In this case, it does not show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation, and it does not refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment. Instead, it sounds robotic or rehearsed, as if following a script or social convention."

This utterance is short, simple, and lacks any unique context or details in response to the previous statement. It serves more as a backchanneling cue rather than an expression of on-the-fly thinking or adaptation. Additionally, it does not provide any personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences, nor does it invite elaboration or ask for new information about the other person. Instead, it is a common response that could be used in various conversations without depending on specific context."

It shows on-the-fly thinking as the speaker is sharing a personal detail about their recent move, which is relevant to the context of the conversation (the other person asking if they want something). Additionally, it refers to unique details in response to the current situation and does not sound robotic or rehearsed. Therefore, the label for this utterance is ""Reflective""."

43,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,80.04,81.74,Yeah,Okay. Cool.,"The current utterance ""Yeah"" can be classified as Automatic. This utterance sounds like a backchanneling cue, which is a common form of nonverbal feedback used during conversations.

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior. The phrase ""too far"" does not appear to be part of a pre-written script and seems like a reaction to the previous statement ""me."" Therefore, it is likely showing some level of thoughtfulness.
2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective. ""Too far"" does not sound robotic or rehearsed, nor does it follow common social openings/greetings/answers. It does not refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation, as it is a general statement. However, it could be seen as a reflection of the speaker's interpretation of the previous statement ""me.""
3. Decide which label fits best. Although the utterance shows some level of thoughtfulness, it does not fully meet the criteria for being considered Reflective since it does not add new information or invite elaboration. However, it could be argued that it is a reflection of the speaker's perception based on the context provided.
4. End every response with the label ""Automatic"" or ""Reflective"". Given the analysis and the fact that while there is some thoughtfulness involved, it does not fully meet all the criteria for Reflective utterances, this phrase can be classified as ""Somewhat Reflective."""

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The word ""All"" does not appear to show either scripted or thoughtful behavior, as it is a simple acknowledgement of the previous speaker's statement.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: This utterance is a single word that repeats part of the previous speaker's sentence and does not add any new information or personal insights. It does not seem to show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation, which are characteristics of reflective utterances. On the other hand, it is not a common social opening/greeting/answer that does not rely on any unique context, which are characteristics of automatic utterances.

3. Decide which label fits best: Given the analysis, this utterance appears to be more of an automatic response rather than a reflective one.

4. End every response with the label ""Automatic"": The current utterance is ""Automatic""."

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The current utterance appears to be a backchanneling cue, which often happens unthinkingly in conversation. However, it can also be used as a filler word to signal attention and interest during the other person's speech.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: The current utterance ""like"" is a backchanneling cue, which can be both automatic (e.g., lone backchanneling cues) and reflective (e.g., shows attention and interest during the other person's speech). However, without more context or additional words, it is challenging to definitively categorize it as either automatic or reflective based on its single word nature.

3. Decide which label fits best: Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the ""like"" is being used in a thoughtful, attention-signaling way or as a mere filler word, it is difficult to classify it accurately as either automatic or reflective.

4. End every response with the label ""Automatic"" or ""Reflective"": Due to the lack of sufficient context, I cannot confidently provide a specific label for this utterance. Please consider providing more words or context to help in the classification process."

3. Decide which label fits best.
   Given that the utterance does not exhibit characteristics of a reflective response, we can classify this utterance as ""Automatic"". This categorization is based on its function as a conjunction to connect ideas rather than adding unique insight or elaboration to the conversation.

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior.
The current utterance ""Well I'm"" appears to lack specific content that suggests a clear script or rehearsed response. Instead, it seems like a common way to start a sentence, which suggests thoughtful behavior rather than scripted.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective.
The current utterance does not sound robotic or rehearsed and does not include typical backchanneling cues. It refers to a unique detail, as it is introducing the speaker, but it is a common social opening that does not rely on any specific context.

3. Decide which label fits best.
Given the ambiguity in whether the utterance refers to a unique detail or a common social opening, it seems more fitting to classify this utterance as ""Reflective"" since it introduces the speaker and implies thoughtful behavior rather than a simple greeting or automatic response.

4. End every response with the label ""Automatic"" or ""Reflective"".

Well,","This utterance shows some signs of thoughtful behavior as it seeks to understand and clarify the previous statement, which could suggest a more reflective approach.

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The current utterance does not seem to contain any indicators of rehearsed or scripted responses, nor does it appear to be an automatic backchanneling cue or a common social greeting. Instead, it seems like a direct response to the previous statement ""It's"" given in the conversation, which appears thoughtful.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: The current utterance refers to a unique detail in response to the context of the conversation (""Permanent."") and does not ask for mundane things unrelated to the speaker or seem robotic or rehearsed. Therefore, it fits better with the definition of a ""Reflective"" utterance.

1. The current utterance ""Stay"" does not show any clear signs of being scripted or rehearsed, nor does it seem thoughtful in this context. It appears to be a simple command, which is often automatic.

2. Comparing the current utterance's features with the definitions provided:
   - The utterance ""Stay"" is short and direct, which can be characteristic of both Automatic and Reflective utterances. However, it does not demonstrate on-the-fly thinking or adaptation, nor does it refer to unique details of the conversation or environment.
   - There are no open-ended questions or addition of new information in this utterance. It also does not ask personal questions to learn about the other person.

2. Let's compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective:
   - The current utterance does not contain common social openings/greetings/answers that do not rely on any unique context, so it is unlikely to be classified as Automatic in this regard.
   - The current utterance does not contain lone backchanneling cues or closed questions that ask for mundane things unrelated to the speaker.
   - However, since we don't know the full context of the conversation, it is difficult to definitively classify the current utterance as Reflective based on whether it refers to unique details in response to the context or environment.

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The utterance ""Um"" is typically used as a filler word to indicate pauses while thinking, suggesting that it may not be rehearsed or following a specific script. However, its brief nature makes it somewhat ambiguous in terms of thoughtfulness.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: The utterance ""Um"" is a common backchanneling cue and does not refer to unique details or rely on the specific context of the conversation. However, it may be used as an indication that the speaker is listening or thinking about the previous statement, which can suggest some level of thoughtfulness.

3. Decide which label fits best: Given the ambiguity in whether the utterance ""Um"" indicates scripted behavior or thoughtful engagement with the conversation, it seems more appropriate to classify it as a borderline case that could fall within both categories. However, for the purpose of this exercise, I will label it as ""Automatic,"" considering its common use as a filler word and lack of unique contextual references.

In this case, the utterance ""many flights"" does not seem to be a scripted response, as it is not typically used in a common greeting or social opening. However, without knowing the context of the conversation, it's hard to definitively say whether it shows on-the-fly thinking.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective.
The utterance ""many flights"" does not sound robotic or rehearsed and is not a common social opening/greeting that does not rely on any unique context. However, it could be considered as a closed question that asks for mundane things unrelated to the speaker (e.g. inquiring about upcoming plans).

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The sentence seems to contain some complex thoughts, indicating it might not be a simple automatic response. However, it does sound somewhat incomplete or disjointed.
2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: Although the sentence is not a common greeting or opening, its structure and content seem unrelated to the immediate context or environment, which suggests some similarities with automatic responses. However, the use of complex thoughts could potentially classify it as reflective.
3. Decide which label fits best: The utterance appears to be somewhat thoughtful but lacks clarity in its connection to the conversation context, making it challenging to definitively classify as either reflective or automatic.

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The utterance seems to be a response to the backchanneling cue (""Mhm"") from the previous speaker, which suggests that this utterance may not necessarily be rehearsed or following a script. However, it lacks some of the personal details or adaptation to the context that one would expect in a truly reflective conversation.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: The current utterance does not show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation (as it doesn't seem to be responding to any specific detail from the conversation). It also does not refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment. However, it is a statement that provides some new information about the speaker, which could be considered slightly reflective as it reveals something personal.

3. Decide which label fits best: Given the slight personal touch and the lack of contextual adaptation, this utterance can be classified as leaning towards ""Reflective,"" but not fully meeting all criteria for a fully reflective utterance.

4. End every response with the label ""Automatic"" or ""Reflective"": Reflective"

This is because it shows on-the-fly thinking and adaptation to the context of the conversation, which is a characteristic of reflective utterances.

Since it does not contain common social openings/greetings, lone backchanneling cues, or closed questions that do not rely on any unique context, I would tentatively classify this utterance as ""Reflective"".

In this case, the utterance does not seem to be overtly rehearsed or following a script, but it also doesn't appear to be showing on-the-fly thinking or adaptation to the other person or current situation. It seems more like an informative response that is likely predictable based on previous context.

Step 2: Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective.
This utterance does not sound robotic, it refers to a unique detail in response to the context (the duration mentioned being seven years), and it is not asking for mundane things unrelated to the speaker. However, it doesn't ask open-ended questions or add new information to invite elaboration, nor does it express personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences.

Step 3: Decide which label fits best.
Given that the utterance refers to a unique detail and is not asking for mundane things unrelated to the speaker, it doesn't fit squarely within the definition of an ""Automatic"" utterance. However, it doesn't quite meet all the criteria for a ""Reflective"" utterance either (it doesn't ask personal questions or express personal thoughts). Since it doesn't strictly adhere to either category but leans more towards reflecting the conversation context, I would classify this as a ""Semi-reflective"" utterance.

Step 4: End every response with the label ""Automatic"" or ""Reflective"".
In this case, the label is ""Semi-reflective""."

Comparing this utterance to the definitions provided:
- It does not appear robotic or rehearsed, but it seems like an attempt to understand the conversation better.
- It does not contain common backchanneling cues or social openings/greetings/answers.
- The question ""heat which"" is more about clarifying the context of the conversation rather than asking a mundane closed question.

1. This utterance seems to be a response to the previous one, which was simply a backchanneling cue (""Uh huh""). Therefore, it appears that the speaker is not following a script or exhibiting thoughtful behavior in this instance.
2. Compared to the definitions provided, this utterance does not sound robotic or rehearsed (it's actually quite clear and direct), but it does not seem to be adapting to the current situation or showing on-the-fly thinking. It is also a closed question that asks for mundane information about nationality.

This is because it is a simple backchanneling cue that does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation, nor does it offer unique details or invite elaboration, as per the definitions provided for Reflective utterances. Instead, it serves as an acknowledgement of the previous speaker's statement and does not necessarily rely on the specific context of the conversation. Therefore, the label for this utterance is ""Automatic""."
548,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,1106.34,1107.86,But yeah,Yeah.,"The current utterance ""But yeah"" can be classified as ""Automatic"". It is a repetition of the affirmative sound (""yeah"") that the other speaker used in their previous utterance, which often happens in automatic or robotic communication.

It does not show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation. It is also a lone backchanneling cue, which is common in automatic utterances.

In this case, it does not refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment, nor does it ask open-ended questions or add new information to invite elaboration. It does not express personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences.

Therefore, the label for the current utterance is ""Automatic""."

551,5f1f2cf5a441a30fa1b79b2d,1111.24,1123.77,"yeah, countries, I'm sorry, so you don't have to be. So it's just that we come through.",move on.,"This current utterance shows some signs of thoughtful behavior as the speaker acknowledges and adapts their response to the previous statement, but it also has elements that could be considered automatic or rehearsed. The phrase ""yeah"" can sometimes be used as a backchannel cue and the repetition of ""countries"" suggests a scripted or memorized response. However, the speaker also adds new information and adapts their initial statement to address the other person's request (""I'm sorry,"" and ""So it's just that we come through"").

Given these mixed signals, it's challenging to categorically label this utterance as either Automatic or Reflective. However, considering the adaptability in the response, I would lean towards classifying it as more Reflective than Automatic.

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The utterance ""Yeah,"" appears to be a common backchanneling cue used in conversation to indicate understanding or acknowledgement without committing to a full response, suggesting it may not reflect much thoughtfulness.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: The utterance ""Yeah,"" is a lone backchanneling cue that does not provide unique context or personal information, similar to common social greetings and answers. It does not invite elaboration or provide new information about the speaker or their environment.

3. Decide which label fits best: Based on the analysis, this utterance can be classified as ""Automatic.""

Comparison: The current utterance does not include common social openings, greetings, answers, backchanneling cues, or closed questions that do not rely on any unique context, which are typical of automatic utterances.

Yeah. Yeah"") provided in the prior utterance. However, it also does not appear to be a thoughtful or reflective statement, given its brevity and lack of additional context or detail.

2. Comparing the features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: This utterance is short, straightforward, and does not rely on unique details or context, which aligns with the characteristics of an ""Automatic"" utterance as defined above.

This response does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation, it sounds robotic or rehearsed and does not provide unique details related to the conversation context. It also does not ask open-ended questions or add new information to invite elaboration.

It appears to be a response based on the immediate context of the conversation and the speaker's thinking, making it more reflective in nature.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective. The current utterance does not contain lone backchanneling cues, nor does it consist of common social openings/greetings/answers that do not rely on any unique context. Instead, it provides a vague location (""around"") and expresses uncertainty (""I don't know""), which are actions that show adaptation to the current situation and invitation for elaboration, making it reflective.

3. Decide which label fits best. Given the analysis of the utterance's behavior, it is more appropriately labeled as ""Reflective"".

4. End every response with the label ""Automatic"" or ""Reflective"".

For future reference, in order for an utterance to be labeled ""Automatic,"" it should typically include lone backchanneling cues or common social openings/greetings, whereas a ""Reflective"" utterance would likely show adaptation, refer to unique details in the conversation context, ask open-ended questions, or express personal thoughts or feelings."

1. The current utterance does not appear thoughtful but rather automatic in response to the previous statement.
2. Compared to the definitions of Automatic and Reflective, this utterance shows a lack of personal thoughts or feelings and no unique details related to the context or environment. It also does not ask open-ended questions or add new information for elaboration.
3. Given the above analysis, it is more fitting to classify the current utterance as ""Automatic"".

1. The current utterance appears to be a single word (""do"") and it does not show any sign of thoughtful behavior or adaptation in response to the previous statement. Instead, it seems like it could be used as a continuation or placeholder in the conversation.
2. Compared to the definitions provided:
   - The current utterance does not seem to sound robotic or rehearsed, but it is a single word without context, making it difficult to determine if it's following a script.
   - It is not a common backchanneling cue like ""I see"", ""right"", etc., but it can be interpreted as a continuation signal.
   - The current utterance does not include common social openings or answers, nor does it provide any unique context.
   - As a single word, the current utterance cannot be classified as a closed question asking for mundane things.

Comparing this utterance with the definitions provided for Automatic and Reflective, it aligns more closely with the characteristics of an ""Automatic"" utterance. The speaker's response is a common social cue (backchanneling) that does not rely on any unique context or invite elaboration.

This utterance does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation, nor does it refer to unique details related to the conversation or environment.

Um",Yeah.,"The current utterance shows somewhat scripted behavior, as it seems to be repeating the affirmation from the previous speaker (""Yeah."") while also offering a minor addition (""Grace, Grace is awesome as well""). This behavior falls under the definition of Automatic utterances.

There is no on-the-fly thinking, adaptation, or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation, and it does not refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation. Furthermore, it is not asking an open-ended question or adding new information to invite elaboration.

The speaker is demonstrating on-the-fly thinking and adaptation by expressing a personal opinion about the economy of a specific country (Greece), which involves unique details in response to the context of the conversation. Furthermore, the speaker refers to their limited knowledge on the subject and expresses an interest in Greece's history, suggesting that they are engaging with the other person and the current situation."

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The utterance ""the ancient Greeks and"" does not seem to exhibit scripted or rehearsed behavior as it does not appear to be a common social opening/greeting, nor does it sound robotic or repetitive.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: This utterance does not provide unique details in response to the conversation context, and it is not asking personal questions or adding new information to invite elaboration. However, it does not sound like a backchanneling cue or closed question asking for mundane things unrelated to the speaker.

3. Decide which label fits best: Although the utterance doesn't fit neatly into either category, given its ambiguity and absence of personal context, I would classify it as ""Automatic."" It is likely that this response was intended as a continuation of the conversation initiated by the other speaker, but without more specific information, it is difficult to definitively label it as ""Reflective"".

4. End every response with the label ""Automatic"": Automatic"
694,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,1371.04,1371.51,Right.,the ancient Greeks and,"The current utterance ""Right."" can be classified as Automatic. This utterance does not show on-the-fly thinking, adaptation or acknowledgement to the other person or current situation, nor does it refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment.

698,5ec8a23062738338f917576a,1373.24,1373.45,"Look,",like like democracy,"This utterance, ""Look,"" can be classified as Automatic. The reason for this classification is that it does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation to the current situation or conversation. Instead, it appears to be a simple directive or attention-grabbing cue, and does not refer to unique details in response to the context or environment of the conversation. It also does not invite elaboration or ask personal questions about the other person, nor does it express personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences."

The utterance ""then when you go there it's like especially"" does not sound robotic or rehearsed, and it appears to show on-the-fly thinking and adaptation as it refers to the context of the conversation, which makes it a response to the previous utterance (""Mhm."") The utterance also invites elaboration by asking implicitly for more information about the place that was previously mentioned.

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior.
In this case, the response ""Yeah"" is a common backchanneling cue that can be used to indicate understanding while the other speaker continues speaking. Since it does not require much thought, we can consider it as showing scripted behavior.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective.
The utterance ""Yeah"" is a lone backchanneling cue and does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation to the other person or current situation. It also does not refer to unique details in response to the context, nor does it ask open-ended questions or add new information to invite elaboration.

3. Decide which label fits best.
Since the utterance ""Yeah"" shows scripted behavior and does not demonstrate any features associated with reflective speech, we can classify it as ""Automatic.""

4. End every response with the label ""Automatic"" or ""Reflective"".
The current utterance is classified as ""Automatic."""

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The word 'Well' is a common filler used in conversations to indicate a pause before speaking or to show a transition between thoughts. It doesn't appear to be following a script, but it also doesn't demonstrate thoughtful adaptation to the context of the conversation.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: The current utterance doesn't refer to unique details from the conversation or environment, nor does it ask open-ended questions or add new information to invite elaboration. It also doesn't express personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences. However, it is not a common social opening/greeting/answer that does not rely on any unique context like ""Hi, how are you?"".

3. Decide which label fits best: Given the analysis, it seems the current utterance ""Well,"" can be classified as an example of an Automatic utterance. It is a lone backchanneling cue and doesn't demonstrate on-the-fly thinking or adaptation to the other person or current situation.

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The utterance ""then it's amazing"" does not seem to follow a specific pattern that would suggest it is being used in a rehearsed manner or in response to a predefined script, so it appears thoughtful.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: This utterance does not contain lone backchanneling cues, common social openings/greetings, closed questions that ask for mundane things unrelated to the speaker, or generic responses (like ""Good morning"" or ""What's up?""). Instead, it seems like an acknowledgement of agreement, which could be reflective since it shows some adaptation to the other person and the current situation. However, it does not refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment.

3. Decide which label fits best: Although the utterance ""then it's amazing"" can be seen as an acknowledgement, it lacks personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences and does not ask open-ended questions or add new information to invite elaboration, which are features associated with reflective utterances. Therefore, this utterance can be considered more automatic than reflective.

Yeah, I didn't"" shows a level of thoughtfulness in response to the previous utterance, indicating that the speaker is acknowledging the other person's perspective (""amazing"") and expressing some curiosity or agreement (""interesting""). However, the response does not reveal unique details about the context of the conversation or environment, nor does it ask open-ended questions or add new information. Therefore, while it shows some level of personal engagement, it can be classified as ""Automatic"" due to its relatively simple and scripted nature compared to a truly reflective response."

1. Analyze whether the current utterance shows scripted or thoughtful behavior: The utterance does not appear to have a rehearsed or robotic tone, suggesting it is more likely thoughtful rather than automatic.

2. Compare features of this utterance to the definitions of Automatic vs. Reflective: This utterance seems to be a part of an ongoing conversation where the speaker is responding to the previous statement with a possible correction or clarification, which does not fall under the category of common social openings/greetings/answers that does not rely on any unique context. However, it does not refer to unique details in response to the context or environment and doesn't ask personal questions.

3. Decide which label fits best: The utterance appears thoughtful and contributes to the conversation by providing a possible correction or clarification, but it does not show features typically associated with reflective utterances such as referring to unique details or asking personal questions. Thus, it can be classified as ""Automatic"".

4. End every response with the label: Automatic."

It's a backchanneling cue that does not show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation and does not provide new information or refer to unique details in the conversation. It's a common response used to signal understanding or agreement during a conversation but does not invite elaboration or reveal personal thoughts, feelings, opinions, or experiences."

This response uses a backchanneling cue (""Yeah"") and is brief, making it sound robotic or rehearsed, which aligns with the definition of an Automatic utterance. Additionally, this statement does not seem to show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation, nor does it refer to unique details in response to the context of the conversation or environment, as required for a Reflective utterance. Instead, it appears to be a simple agreement with the previous speaker's statement about something being small."

It serves as a backchanneling cue, which are typically automatic responses used to signal attention and understanding during a conversation. In this case, it does not demonstrate on-the-fly thinking or adaptation based on the unique context of the conversation. Instead, it follows the previous speaker's statement without adding any new information or personal thoughts or feelings."

Comparing features, the utterance does not seem to rely on any unique context provided by the conversation, nor does it show on-the-fly thinking or adaptation. But it does refer to a specific country (Luxembourg) which could be considered as a reflection of the current situation or environment.

Given that the utterance is neither clearly automatic nor reflective due to its mixed characteristics, let's consider it as a borderline case between the two categories.

But in this case, given the limited information provided, it fits more closely with the definition of an ""Automatic"" utterance."

This utterance, therefore, can be classified as ""Automatic""."
