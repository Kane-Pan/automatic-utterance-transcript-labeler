speaker,utterance
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,They didn't say that in the thing.
M2,That was weird hhh hhh hhh.
M1,publicly distributed
M2,Weird was it.
M1,I didn't read that.
M2,laughed.
M1,"the well, the unintelligible was."
M2,"Okay, let's not talk about terrorism."
M1,no: one
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"You know if you're going to get pregnant, you have to."
M2,"[UNINTELLIGIBLE], [UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M1,that's not good.
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,saw you um-
M2,No: (slow)
M1,they had this little scene where the guys.
M2,yes
M1,you see this scene in Washington.
M2,Silence
M1,voice identified identity [!] (deet deet deet deet deet)
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"voice, number: blah blo blo blah-ha-ha"
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [LAUGH]
M1,you know so it's the nonsense listening in.
M2,"worked for them, huh? (unclear continuation)"
M1,He was a nice guy.
M2,"he, well, he used to work for them, yeah."
M1,What happened to Linda Lee?
M2,"She just left, um, I guess back in May."
M1,"she did her two years, then she left."
M2,"she left a little prematurely, huh, huh, huh, huh."
M1,ah hah laughed
M2,"She was unhappy with her advisor, and she ended up not being too happy."
M1,I saw what a surprise.
M2,"um, no, she got married. And, um, and they got married in March."
M1,"laughed ah, ah hah"
M2,she was sort of eager to like leave and.
M1,yes (hiccup)
M2,live with her husband and [UNINTELLIGIBLE] um.
M1,"I knew well, I guess her husband wasn't from Pittsburgh."
M2,She also just.
M1,correct
M2,it's not the same guy
M1,no (heading up)
M2,She actually met him right at the end of graduate school.
M1,boy [exclamation mark]
M2,"she's at the door now, hi. It's actually our upstairs neighbor. Yes, she met him recently."
M1,"ah, ha-ha."
M2,"She just graduated, like, at the end."
M1,they didn't break up.
M2,"they'd only been known to each other like for about two months or so. and, no, they didn't break up."
M1,oh my god
M2,They continued in a long-distance relationship for the whole.
M1,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,That's something [!]
M2,"they said so, um, yeah, then they got married and she also said that she wasn't all happy."
M1,"Yes, well"
M2,"she started talking about things that rang a bell like every week before going to the meeting with her. Every time she told her, her advisor would tell her, and then come back to the meeting next time, her advisor said, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], who I still won't name in case this is being taped."
M1,[UNINTELLIGIBLE] hhh hhh [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M2,psychology research [UNINTELLIGIBLE] (laughter) hhh hhh hhh
M1,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M2,"but I um, but [something unintelligible]."
M1,that may be publicly distributed
M2,you would have forgotten what she asked her to do the previous week and you know.
M1,"yes, then if they why didn't you do this."
M2,everything was always harshly critical
M1,yes
M2,"and so, she wasn't very happy"
M1,this and it everything other things (is) well what do you mean is this better or is this better?
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,consider all the possibilities and why don't you.
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,write the repo then
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE] hhh [UNINTELLIGIBLE] hhh
M1,"she says - we'll, you know in the report you said this was better."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,point of this is like well the whole thing
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE] . [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,thought you were supposed to do what you: thought [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [smiling voice].
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"already knew what I thought, so why did I have to write this out."
M2,Unintelligible (due to repetitive 'hhh' sounds)
M1,"you know, yeah."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE] (laughter)
M1,So you want to hear what my job is.
M2,yes I do desperately (0.2) hhh
M1,okay I have a six-month contract.
M2,"ah, ha-ha."
M1,"Like, I went to this place and I said, okay, I don't want this, it's like Bell Corp basically."
M2,yes:h
M1,"knowing fully well, I wanted to do something with HTI, but I didn't know what HTI was."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"they pegged me as a user, as a user interface designer."
M2,yes (slightly elongated)
M1,"you knew, so I was thinking like, h + t + i:: including like you know, prototype testing where you go out and you test."
M2,sure yea
M1,"like you know, assessing users needs where you collect a lot of survey information and you analyze it with SPSS or whatever fh."
M2,right: yeah
M1,"No
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M2,there's a there's a leash
M1,No noise
M2,"Noo, no: noo."
M1,interaction face deserved [NOISE]
M2,okay (unintelligible sound)
M1,"The guy who designs the interface and now I'm working in a group, there are like half a dozen people."
M2,uh-huh
M1,there's a man and there are two guys who go out and they want to know what it is that the users want.
M2,right
M1,"they do one of the things, they show the video to the people, and they had the thing that the Republicans use."
M2,laughed ah ha
M1,people turn it into a joke when Reagan says something stupid.
M2,"right, yeah yeah that little know, yeah"
M1,they and so they cut out all the disapproved
M2,yes
M1,that's what they use
M2,wow
M1,They use that.
M2,Who are they doing the software for?
M1,Are doing the soft a Bell Northern
M2,Yes
M1,This is the main competitor of ATT for:
M2,Okay
M1,stuff
M2,Okay
M1,they also design telephones because you know what they do - they make people buy telephones that you need all this extra stuff.
M2,hm
M1,"the people buy the telephones, so then the telephone company says we have to buy all"
M2,[silence]
M1,process the bandwidth wide.
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,They have to buy more switches and that's where they make
M2,right
M1,they have a really cool telephone that's coming out now.
M2,"It's got a little screen on it. (Mmm, yes.)"
M1,"you can and you can do it, they have it, people have it in there."
M2,"yes, mm-hm (affirmative sound)"
M1,"has a long screen. It's about, like, eight rows by sixty columns or twenty-four columns by some thing."
M2,that's not bad
M1,"and you can like, write and it'll say when they called. then they [can] leave, they can leave a little you know (where) you can hear the voice mail and- it can do telephone banking."
M2,wow
M1,"and all sorts of movies, whatever you want."
M2,"yes, umm (or something similar)"
M1,"So that's their new thing, that they're coming out to make people buy more switches."
M2,yeah huh huh huh huh huh huh [laughing] huh huh huh [UNINTELLIGIBLE] huh huh huh
M1,"that's one of the things they have and they also have this - Pennsylvania thing, this is the University of Pennsylvania."
M2,what's up
M1,"University of Pennsylvania this phone stuff, this phone recording."
M2,"oh yes, yes."
M1,"they're the guys and it's William Labov, if you might be familiar with him."
M2,oh sure [no exclamation mark]
M1,yes
M2,yes
M1,"He's the one who worked with them, the guys in Montreal, for and some other guys. I think there were also some in Quebec City. [STATIC]"
M2,ah hah looked up
M1,"to develop, static for a second, unintelligible user in, uh, uh, to use independent speaker, independently, speech recognition software."
M2,Wow.
M1,"This: and it seems I think that this, this. Stuff that they're recording now is probably for that program that they're working with."
M2,"right, right"
M1,it's probably a continuation of that
M2,Labor is the same guy who did the cups.
M1,yes:h
M2,This to the sauce-makers.
M1,yeses
M2,"wasn't it cups to glasses, or"
M1,yes
M2,haha (short)
M1,"He's a linguist, that's him."
M2,yes
M1,"he only did that - you know, from a linguistic perspective."
M2,"Yes and that was a long time ago, too."
M1,"Year 1973, that was."
M2,yes
M1,"they're continuing, and so I think that they are continuing. You can call up and it gives you the stock market report. And, it asks you what company do you hear the stock market report for."
M2,It's got a finite number of things it has to.
M1,about you around six thousand or
M2,yes
M1,some
M2,"Yeah, I agree."
M1,"and you say I don't want a stock market report and it says [/] Texas up blah blah exchange and you know, what do you want to hear."
M2,yes
M1,it's got like six thousand companies.
M2,yes
M1,"That's pretty cool, and that's the kind of stuff they do. And, but my job, huh huh this is my job huh huh. I have to make a Macromind Director movie. That's my job."
M2,really [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,yes
M2,"Wow, wow, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], wow."
M1,whole job constituted it
M2,"movie or is it a movie like the interface in action, what's it?"
M1,"I can't tell you, that's a secret."
M2,"oh, hehe hehe hehe hehe laughed."
M1,But you know I'm going to have to put Quicktime stuff in
M2,yes
M1,and you they didn't want to put that speech
M2,Right.
M1,"So they can do speech recognition. I'm unintelligible, something about a touch screen. It's going to have and it's going to be on a touch screen."
M2,m: [EXCITED]
M1,first thing you touch screen
M2,"I'm sorry, there seems to be no actual speech in the given line. The output should be [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."
M1,"So I have to design, like a problem space, interface, you know."
M2,Right
M1,operator every time they push a button
M2,Right
M1,changes the problem space to a different state.
M2,Right up.
M1,and so I have to do a task analysis basically of the demo that I'm going to set up.
M2,[Static]
M1,It's kind of not really necessarily a working thing.
M2,"you know, yeah"
M1,"This guy and I were talking, and he goes to the local, um, and I say to him I go to the local, and actually, this is weird, yeah I was talking to a guy at-, and I (pause) and I, uh, go to the local, and uh, there's these, like, computer human interaction meetings."
M2,yeah (interjection)
M1,the man took it.
M2,"right -> I'm sure, yeah"
M1,I was talking to a guy who does research at one of the universities here. And he was talking about this machine that's a software program that's really doing good for finite state modeling.
M2,"had this, [!] (unintelligible breaths)"
M1,"he says, you know we use that for you for human-computer interaction designing, you know, it's for models that can be described in a finite way."
M2,Silence. Static. Silence.
M1,I'm thinking finite state machine isn't like the problem space.
M2,"yes, he [NOISE]"
M1,I come up and I ask him.
M2,Silence
M1,you know but he says and he's
M2,silence
M1,"Going on and on, you know."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"my students don't know anything about this, and they can't use it. And I'm thinking, isn't this a problem? And there's no way they'd understand this."
M2,"huh huh, heheh heheh heheh"
M1,"So, I go up and I ask him after."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"he isn't this just problem space, stuff and he said yeah and I said well you know so why what's the problem then don't they all learn this in class."
M2,"UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE"
M1,"he said, no psychologist knows that."
M2,"he, hhh hhh, hhh hhh hhh, hhh."
M1,talking about every psychologist
M2,on only at hhh CMU
M1,"yes, heh yes so [UNINTELLIGIBLE], one of those CMU [!] things"
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,Totally: [!]
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"human-computer interaction is essentially what it is, they analyze tasks."
M2,mhm.
M1,and then they wrote down the statistics and the operators on pieces of paper.
M2,mhm (affirmative sound)
M1,"and then they find someone and they say you know, here's the state, here's the operator, go through the station. and they find the places where they have impasses. and they fix them. That's it"
M2,"right, up"
M1,that's about the total of it.
M2,Right.
M1,"They don't even do analysis, they just don't try to find out what you know."
M2,right
M1,"they don't even do that yet, so I'm saying that they were going to have to do that."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"you know, as a psychologist, I'm building up my own skills."
M2,right up
M1,a degree
M2,Right
M1,"that's my job, I play around with Macromedia Director"
M2,it's fun going up
M1,We'll I just started this week
M2,yes
M1,"they wanted me to read some reports, of the focus groups and subjects you know, with huh."
M2,Yes
M1,watch some videos and write down the functions I'm gonna
M2,yes (nodding in agreement)
M1,"just tell them that you are just macromind's director, but it's complicated"
M2,that's what I've heard [exclamation mark]
M1,"they even have like you know, they even have stuff where you can write C code, and that you can create an object and then have port and use that inside Macromind Director, so I might have to learn C++."
M2,yuck
M1,"you told them you know, I said look hhh [!] (0.2) you know hhh I don't know how to program in C plus plus hhh so if you have me do that hhh"
M2,yes
M1,you better know that I don't know how to do that
M2,"Yes, ah, yeah."
M1,"but of course, we'll see what happens."
M2,[Click] [Click]
M1,"the other guys working on a project that's similar to him has to make a movie too, but he's having all problems because he needs to connect to one and you know, he can't get a database because he doesn't. Know which database it connects to. [/] He can't even get FTP, he's not allowed to do FTP, cause they're all security"
M2,"I'm
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M1,student won't get FTP.
M2,"hm, [static]"
M1,"You can't tell, and there's all this big stuff they're talking about. They don't seem to be very organized. It's like CMU basically."
M2,yes
M1,you know
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,knows us: specifically
M2,right
M1,"you know that's the only difference but the rest is:- you know, we only have one manual, and basically that's it."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,it's all the same
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,There's nobody you can call and say you know what program.
M2,yes
M1,They don't know
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"and nobody talks to each other, so you know and they have this whole interface that sits on top, (0.2) [STATIC] that you can use to import objects into it, and you know they didn't"
M2,silence
M1,"so, um, he kind of like, did you ever finish your thesis?"
M2,"I finished, yeah."
M1,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M2,sort of
M1,Sort of [unintelligible]
M2,"I finished it, but I haven't uploaded it yet."
M1,written it up for public.
M2,"It's written yeah, it's written. I haven't handed in the actual."
M1,Oh.
M2,zero exes of it to the static to the um- like private people you know
M1,Oh.
M2,like he
M1,"you did have it in them, they signed all the right"
M2,"Yes, yes"
M1,okay so that means you don't have to pay anymore
M2,"right, yeah, I'm all done."
M1,That's good.
M2,"productive member of society finally, I guess yeah I am."
M1,yes (possibly with a slight hiccup)
M2,"I can't hear you clearly. You said something like ""I, hh hh hh hh hh""."
M1,"Yeah, I'm starting this too. Wee."
M2,great yes
M1,I sent my thing to Jay.
M2,ah-ha (laughter)
M1,yes and he said that he was going to read it
M2,great [exclamation mark]
M1,and told me what they cut out
M2,yes [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,it's a bit long [exclamation]
M2,how long
M1,Silence (static noise) [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M2,holy mackerel
M1,"and that's only with three pages of references, because I"
M2,Jees.
M1,"didn't lose them, but they were in another file."
M2,"yes, [static] → yeah."
M1,good to know
M2,"I just saw Sean Verace:ra defending on Monday, his."
M1,yes ah (something about it)
M2,"about one hundred and fifty pages, or around that number."
M1,That's pretty big [exclamation].
M2,"it looked really good, it looked really professional. I figured they probably already published most of that or the box to publish that kind of thing. [STATIC] [UNINTELLIGIBLE] that was it looked."
M1,he shouldn't have made it look that way then.
M2,huh huh huh huh
M1,Who cares
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"I guess that depends on who's on your committee with Jay, you know like they care."
M2,"Yes, Jay is on his committee."
M1,yes
M2,"John, heh, +≈ [UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M1,"well, put the glasses on."
M2,"Yes, yeah."
M1,Martha
M2,"Martha, yeah."
M1,"yeah well, she probably didn't care either"
M2,"Martha in a long distance, ah yeah, I think he's just gonna know."
M1,yes.
M2,He's really a workaholic and [unintelligible].
M1,"he got a job in Utah, right."
M2,Utah [lip smack sound]
M1,I think so
M2,I can't remember.
M1,"Ida who Uta? Uta huh (0.4) yeah, Uta cause he's near Idaho."
M2,really oh.
M1,"you'll find out, you can ask."
M2,"yes, I'll find out."
M1,Catherine told me that he got a job in Utah.
M2,[SILENCE]
M1,And did Akira get a job somewhere in there.
M2,"I am
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
(m)

Alternative interpretation:
I am (unintelligible) m

This second interpretation is possible due to the presence of ""(m)"" in the original, but it requires making an assumption about the ""m"" being part of a word and not a separate markup. The first interpretation seems more likely given that ""(m)"" doesn't appear to be a commonly used conversational marker or symbol."
M1,colorado or
M2,"Colorado, University of Colorado."
M1,"That's where Catherine Read is, University of Colorado."
M2,"That's right, yeah."
M1,"She's at the University of Denver, not the University of Colorado."
M2,"They're close, huh huh huh."
M1,"They're yeah, they're close."
M2,"he, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M1,"yeah, so are you looking for a job."
M2,"I'm not going to, I'll stay here for another year [!] [IN THE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M1,You got money.
M2,"same job, well we'll get our grant sort of, huh huh"
M1,"oh, yeah."
M2,"we just found out and we got a really great priority score, we're gonna be funded."
M1,you don't know how much (but).
M2,we'll probably get as much as they can give us.
M1,yes
M2,cause priority scores are so high.
M1,yes
M2,but you're them
M1,Until Newt gets a hold of it.
M2,"right, that's one thing actually"
M1,and
M2,"other thing isn't voted until now, but since it wasn't, they're in the next fiscal year."
M1,oh.
M2,"they don't have to find us until the following fiscal year, or you know something bureaucratic like that."
M1,"I got it, yeah, yeah."
M2,"instead of getting funded on October fifteen-th, we don't have to get funded until the latest next October fifteen-th, or something."
M1,"I get it, yeah."
M2,so I (0.3) and an
M1,they don't have the appropriations for that.
M2,Yes [!]
M1,They might not the ones.
M2,year. They tend to save it all up until the end of the year.
M1,yes
M2,we're hoping it's not going to.
M1,yes
M2,"since sincerely, since we do have a good priority score, we might."
M1,"I hope you didn't name your proposal, you know, they- [UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M2,He huh huh huh [!]
M1,the last time that they killed a bunch of
M2,ah hhh [NOISE]
M1,"the one that had no title, it got killed."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"So: (ignoring the non-speech symbols and markup) we get ""so:"" which is probably short for ""so,"", or possibly ""sow"" if referring to an animal. However, without more context, it's hard to determine the exact word or phrase. Therefore, I will output [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."
M2,"I can't remember the name, but I'm sure it was impressive."
M1,"A good title is really, really, really important and crucial research."
M2,ah:h
M1,that won't get any Republicans united [exclaimed]
M2,"I: huh huh huh.
or
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] (if you prefer to handle the repeated ""hhh"" as unintelligible noise)"
M1,that's what you should have called it
M2,"it's unfortunately more likely for it to have to be done, it's more likely to get cut."
M1,yes
M2,"normal like um, you know, how people shoot down missiles."
M1,yes:h
M2,"He, huh, huh, huh."
M1,yes
M2,Republican thing. [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"This was the guy at Byrd, from West, and there's another one they cut. You know another one, right?"
M2,aha
M1,they really hated one that was called
M2,"They used to work for them, hhh hhh hhh."
M1,cut that one out
M2,he he he he [UNINTELLIGIBLE] hhh hhh laughter.
M1,"It's true, they actually did that one."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"and, out."
M2,UNINTELLIGIBLE
M1,"all the big guys you know, got together, oh no, we don't."
M2,He went huh huh huh.
M1,they don't want them digging into our close(s).
M2,he he he he (uhm) he.
M1,totally obvious
M2,yes. [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"So, I am telling you that Janice is pregnant."
M2,Yeah (ascending)
M1,"and the kids are due on Halloween, rising."
M2,Halloween you oh [exclamation mark]
M1,"we're hoping it's on Halloween, yeah (we'll)."
M2,"oh, uh-oh [NOISE]"
M1,That would be cool.
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,we could name it like
M2,"no, but it's not"
M1,Nothing
M2,"couldn't be that great for the kid cause like, they they couldn't have a birthday party every year, the other kids would be going to Halloween. [LAUGH]"
M1,"we could do it like that next week, but it's not as good as we could do it like that."
M2,"No, no, yeah."
M1,Close to Christmas like you know if you're born on
M2,right
M1,nobody's gonna buy you another one.
M2,it's a real let-down (pause) hhh
M1,Halloween isn't bad.
M2,yes
M1,good
M2,"""huh huh huh huh"""
M1,"Call him Damien, or something similar."
M2,"I'm afraid it seems like there are exclamation marks and special characters that don't represent speech in the provided line. To clean it, I would remove those elements as they don't contribute to understanding the spoken sentence:

+≈ hh hhh hhh hhh hh hh ∙hhh

After removing the non-speech symbols and markup, the cleaned sentence becomes:

hh hhh hhh hhh hh hh

Unfortunately, this line contains only ""h"" sounds repeated multiple times, which doesn't translate into a meaningful spoken sentence in English. So the output remains as:

[UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M1,"How's it going in general? You like your job, right?"
M2,"It's all right, you're um- correct."
M1,getting any publications.
M2,No: (or) Nope
M1,"I can't determine a spoken sentence from the provided symbol ""↗"". It seems to be an arrow or marker of some sort. Therefore, I would output [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."
M2,"it's not, it's kind of a dead end"
M1,yes
M2,"If we'd gotten funding early, there would have been money in it for me to become a real post."
M1,remember you said that
M2,"I'm still just a guess, until we get that money."
M1,Right
M2,"you know, run the show [exclamation], he [hiccup]."
M1,Yes.
M2,"and you, I did get one, I actually got one"
M1,"Yes, he uh-huh."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,Yeah
M2,doing it [!] (Yeah)
M1,It seems obvious [!]
M2,I thought about that.
M1,only apply to one place
M2,"I thought about that, definitely."
M1,"so, you know, making Macroindie Director movies, it's not genius work."
M2,yes
M1,"they also hired me, I think one of the reasons they did so was because they were about the behavioral implications like."
M2,right
M1,they might be interested in me for those reasons.
M2,Yes
M1,"I'm not really hired for that, I'm in ok with that though which is user interface design. That's right there. I saw this talk with this (0.2) lunatic woman who's applying for a permanent job, I don't have like a... but this lunatic woman who's applying for a permanent position."
M2,"ah static (interrupting), ah-ha (laughs)"
M1,This is what she did.
M2,"She went to England because she couldn't, as she didn't know how to speak English; she's Brazilian. This is one of the things she did in more than one domain. And she did this [!] in (0.4). Moreover, she went to England."
M1,Manchester's Advanced Technical Researcher
M2,"I laughed, went up."
M1,"and they told her well, you know, you do whatever you cause they had, (0.3), you know, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], guessing they had the medical records"
M2,ah-ha
M1,she goes around to hospitals and pokes around the hospitals and staff.
M2,silent
M1,"she starts, you know one of the things she does is she watches and waits."
M2,mhm
M1,this woman she has
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"an ergonomics backgroup, a biomechanics design backgroup and a production backgroup."
M2,ah ha-ha
M1,"engineering background like people who study how you produce goods in manufacturing, and fix your production techniques. She has one or two PhD's."
M2,Okay.
M1,I can't remember.
M2,[Static] (no words spoken)
M1,"They look at the surgeons, and this is really weird, you'd think it wouldn't be, but their surgical instruments are basically out of order and they haven't changed for a hundred and fifty years. And so, they're using one like...you know one of the examples she had that was really horrible, it was really disgusting. It was really disgraceful, [unintelligible] that's a needle holder, and you know they don't - they don't hold the needles with their hands, they hold (a pause) hh."
M2,"ah, ha."
M1,"like the kind of scissors you'd cut your nails with, so it's got a little short handle. They're not."
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,one handle's longer than the other
M2,"Listening to M1, is M2 paying attention to the TV?"
M1,"they figure they put their thumb and finger through, do that [!] but they don't [!]"
M2,mhm (nodding sound)
M1,They don't put any fingers through either of the holes.
M2,what did they do?
M1,"they take the long handle, and they jam their little finger right above the hole, right above the loo::p, and they put their thumb along the small handle, don't put their thumb through the hole either. Then they take their index finger and extend it where the crew is."
M2,okay [?] up
M1,you know the screw that holds the two parts
M2,right went yeah
M1,they kind of like guide the whole thing with their index finger and they sort of hold it like a gun.
M2,"I see, yeah okay, not now."
M1,Yeah
M2,"yes, okay"
M1,"with their index finger, sticks out and that's how, but of course because of the shape of the thing. They also turn their writsts like."
M2,mhm.
M1,and Ben's backs were so that their heads met
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,Over the patent.
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"and you (0.3) basically, the whole posture's just"
M2,yes
M1,these guys probably get carpal tunnel.
M2,right guys [!]
M1,They had pictures of how they were holding them and it was horrible.
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,my god [exclamation]
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"She said, ""I'm all surgical."""
M2,really
M1,"she had fifty-six thousand frames of video tape. [UNINTELLIGIBLE] so, this is what she did."
M2,mhm (nodding affirmation)
M1,"From that, she selected three hundred and forty frames."
M2,mhm (affirmative noise)
M1,that best represented that gave her good shots
M2,mhm
M1,"she then did for thirty-six instruments, generally for surgical ones. She decided to redesign them. Because they were originally barbers, barbers were surgeons."
M2,"right, that's right [!] (exclamation mark removed)"
M1,Oh:h
M2,yeah [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"They all look like that, and they haven't changed since the '80s."
M2,yes
M1,five eight
M2,"That's incredible, I didn't know that."
M1,"yes, and (unintelligible sound)"
M2,"thought there was a good reason for that [You know, huh huh huh huh]"
M1,there is no good reason reasons are people are
M2,Yes [exclamation mark]
M1,that's the reason no one has done it before.
M2,yes
M1,she did prototype-like for the need-le holder pointing up.
M2,"ah, up"
M1,"she did a fortified prototype of that, using a pen and paper prototype, where she"
M2,right static.
M1,"she analyzed all hand movements, as a function of ergonomicists have this little known biometrical data, and then drew all hand movements on it."
M2,mhm
M1,"for each prototype, she was well, for each class of prototype"
M2,right upward
M1,she did (0.3) a paper prototype and picked up (off) them just (how) you would hold it.
M2,Right.
M1,"she and coordinate space so that you could see you, then she did plastic prototypes, then she did metal prototypes, and she had the surgeons. You know, pick and of course the metal prototypes are designed, based, and so the surgeons tried those out and they said hhh yeah this is great hhh you know hhh let's. So then she goes to a manufacturer to analyze how."
M2,mhm
M1,"and this is how they do it they have molds, and they pour the gunk into it then they take it out of molds, and they have these, and bending all the pieces by hand."
M2,mhm
M1,"okay, so it's basically a hand job handcrafted."
M2,mhm
M1,"She redesigns the production process, using strips of metal instead."
M2,mhm.
M1,"that can be identified, (0.5) you know, by a machine rather"
M2,Right
M1,"and since she's using cutting strips of metal off, you know you can polish them and stuff, you don't need to."
M2,yes
M1,"she redesigns the whole production process for each of her, and then they're kind of like the companies were, and she left England."
M2,Oh!
M1,silence
M2,[Silence (0.4)]
M1,"she was done, so she left."
M2,"Right, yeah."
M1,"she also did this, the same thing, for like other domains. She measured people from Brazil, and the size, the weight, she did about five hundred pairs of feet."
M2,"okay (0.7) - The colon implies a slight elongation of the word ""okay"". So, the cleaned sentence is: Okay."
M1,"stations. She designed and built her own measuring station, which had thirty different stations."
M2,"he, huh [laughter]."
M1,Kay.
M2,laughter he
M1,"she also took footprints, like you know, on and she had to design her own plastic, (0.3) rubber."
M2,right
M1,"she mapped all of that out and then she went to some factory and redesigned their shoe, you know their leather cutting process so that they would save more."
M2,silent [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,and they would use less leather.
M2,"""mhm, m:mm"" or ""mhm, mumbling"""
M1,junior leather cutters were as good as you
M2,right upward
M1,they're using this technique to make their technique now
M2,I'm: talking [NOISE]
M1,"and she did like, haha, you know"
M2,yes [EXCITED]
M1,"yeah, so it's just totally she's a total lunatic"
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
M1,"Basically, she's like."
M2,"yes, he [UNINTELLIGIBLE]"
M1,She's her own vertically integrated.
M2,yes
M1,corporation
M2,"Right, yeah."
M1,"I don't know if they're going to hire her though, but it was just."
M2,"he, h, h, h, h, h, exclamation, h, h, [exclamation], breath."
M1,and she said she has a book.
M2,Wow [!]
M1,Yeah (no breathings or other symbols included in the original)
M2,Brazil
M1,you said it wasn't actually written as I don't know what it was written.
M2,okay.
M1,"they were already on the second edition, as it was already out."
M2,ah
M1,I don't know if they're going to hire her.
M2,"yes, right"
M1,Hi
M2,"Hi oh, Linda says hi smiling and laughing a bit."
M1,That's good Hi Linda
M2,"Actually um, I was going to go, do you want to talk to Linda for a bit about your police."

M2,problem. went up
M1,"yes, oh yeah"
M2,"she might actually have reference, you know, she could point you to or find out an answer for."
M1,"That would be good, yeah."
M2,yes
F1,Canadian law increased
M2,"Not Canadian law, American law, it's not, it's [% to F1]. [!] Here I'll put her on, and I'll be right back. [% to M1]"
M1,Okay
M2,"Okay, [UNINTELLIGIBLE] (staticity for two seconds). Phone clicking sounds."
F1,This Norman.
M1,yes hi Linda
F1,"hi, how are you."
M1,"pretty good, how are you?"
F1,"What a surprise, good [exclamation mark]."

F2,I'll try.
F1,But I heard your news.
F2,Yeah [exclamation]
F1,"second or third had hand hh hhh hhh hhh [!]
(Clean: The original sentence might have been ""The second or third one had a hand"", but it's difficult to determine due to the exclamation mark.)"
F2,hm hm hm hm
F1,That's exciting!
F2,"We're very, yeah, we were freaked out a little bit, because we have three and a half more months."
F1,that's still not very far it is [!]

F1,"man, oh man"
F2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
F1,[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

F1,physically
F2,yes
F1,ahahaha
F2,"I was really, I had really bad morning sickness."
