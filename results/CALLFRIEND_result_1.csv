M2,you would have forgotten what she asked her to do the previous week and you know.,3,3
M1,"yes, then if they why didn't you do this.",2,3
M2,everything was always harshly critical,4,4
M1,yes,2,2
M2,"and so, she wasn't very happy",3,2
M1,this and it everything other things (is) well what do you mean is this better or is this better?,3,2
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],3,1
M1,consider all the possibilities and why don't you.,3,3
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,write the repo then,2,3

M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],3,2
M1,point of this is like well the whole thing,3,2
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE] . [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,2
M1,thought you were supposed to do what you: thought [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [smiling voice].,3,3
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],3,2
M1,"already knew what I thought, so why did I have to write this out.",3,2
M2,Unintelligible (due to repetitive 'hhh' sounds),2,1
M1,"you know, yeah.",3,1
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE] (laughter),2,1
M1,So you want to hear what my job is.,3,3
M2,yes I do desperately (0.2) hhh,3,2
M1,okay I have a six-month contract.,3,4
M2,"ah, ha-ha.",2,1
M1,"Like, I went to this place and I said, okay, I don't want this, it's like Bell Corp basically.",3,4
M2,yes:h,3,2
M1,"knowing fully well, I wanted to do something with HTI, but I didn't know what HTI was.",2,3
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,2
M1,"they pegged me as a user, as a user interface designer.",3,3
M2,yes (slightly elongated),2,2
M1,"you knew, so I was thinking like, h + t + i:: including like you know, prototype testing where you go out and you test.",3,4
M2,sure yea,3,1
M1,"like you know, assessing users needs where you collect a lot of survey information and you analyze it with SPSS or whatever fh.",3,4
M2,right: yeah,2,1
M1,"No
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]",2,1
M2,there's a there's a leash,2,2
M1,No noise,2,2
M2,"Noo, no: noo.",2,1
M1,interaction face deserved [NOISE],2,2
M2,okay (unintelligible sound),3,2
M1,"The guy who designs the interface and now I'm working in a group, there are like half a dozen people.",3,4
M2,uh-huh,2,1
M1,there's a man and there are two guys who go out and they want to know what it is that the users want.,3,4
M2,right,3,2
M1,"they do one of the things, they show the video to the people, and they had the thing that the Republicans use.",3,4
M2,laughed ah ha,2,1
M1,people turn it into a joke when Reagan says something stupid.,2,3
M2,"right, yeah yeah that little know, yeah",2,2
M1,they and so they cut out all the disapproved,2,3
M2,yes,2,1
M1,that's what they use,3,2
M2,wow,2,1
M1,They use that.,2,3
M2,Who are they doing the software for?,3,4
M1,Are doing the soft a Bell Northern,2,2
M2,Yes,2,2
M1,This is the main competitor of ATT for:,3,4
M2,Okay,2,1
M1,stuff,2,1
M2,Okay,2,1
M1,they also design telephones because you know what they do - they make people buy telephones that you need all this extra stuff.,2,4
M2,hm,2,1
M1,"the people buy the telephones, so then the telephone company says we have to buy all",2,3
M2,[silence],2,1
M1,process the bandwidth wide.,2,1
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,They have to buy more switches and that's where they make,2,3
M2,right,2,2
M1,they have a really cool telephone that's coming out now.,3,4
M2,"It's got a little screen on it. (Mmm, yes.)",2,2
M1,"you can and you can do it, they have it, people have it in there.",3,4
M2,"yes, mm-hm (affirmative sound)",3,2
M1,"has a long screen. It's about, like, eight rows by sixty columns or twenty-four columns by some thing.",2,4
M2,that's not bad,2,2
M1,"and you can like, write and it'll say when they called. then they [can] leave, they can leave a little you know (where) you can hear the voice mail and- it can do telephone banking.",3,4
M2,wow,2,1
M1,"and all sorts of movies, whatever you want.",3,3
M2,"yes, umm (or something similar)",2,1
M1,"So that's their new thing, that they're coming out to make people buy more switches.",3,4
M2,yeah huh huh huh huh huh huh [laughing] huh huh huh [UNINTELLIGIBLE] huh huh huh,2,1
M1,"that's one of the things they have and they also have this - Pennsylvania thing, this is the University of Pennsylvania.",3,4
M2,what's up,2,1
M1,"University of Pennsylvania this phone stuff, this phone recording.",3,4
M2,"oh yes, yes.",2,2
M1,"they're the guys and it's William Labov, if you might be familiar with him.",3,4
M2,oh sure [no exclamation mark],3,2
M1,yes,3,1
M2,yes,3,1
M1,"He's the one who worked with them, the guys in Montreal, for and some other guys. I think there were also some in Quebec City. [STATIC]",3,3
M2,ah hah looked up,2,2
M1,"to develop, static for a second, unintelligible user in, uh, uh, to use independent speaker, independently, speech recognition software.",2,3
M2,Wow.,2,1
M1,"This: and it seems I think that this, this. Stuff that they're recording now is probably for that program that they're working with.",3,3
M2,"right, right",2,1
M1,it's probably a continuation of that,3,2
M2,Labor is the same guy who did the cups.,3,3
M1,yes:h,3,2
M2,This to the sauce-makers.,2,2
M1,yeses,2,1
M2,"wasn't it cups to glasses, or",3,3
M1,yes,2,2
M2,haha (short),2,1
M1,"He's a linguist, that's him.",3,4
M2,yes,2,2
M1,"he only did that - you know, from a linguistic perspective.",2,2
M2,"Yes and that was a long time ago, too.",3,2
M1,"Year 1973, that was.",2,3
M2,yes,2,2
M1,"they're continuing, and so I think that they are continuing. You can call up and it gives you the stock market report. And, it asks you what company do you hear the stock market report for.",2,3
M2,It's got a finite number of things it has to.,2,2
M1,about you around six thousand or,2,2
M2,yes,2,2
M1,some,3,2
M2,"Yeah, I agree.",3,1
M1,"and you say I don't want a stock market report and it says [/] Texas up blah blah exchange and you know, what do you want to hear.",3,3
M2,yes,2,2
M1,it's got like six thousand companies.,2,4
M2,yes,2,1
M1,"That's pretty cool, and that's the kind of stuff they do. And, but my job, huh huh this is my job huh huh. I have to make a Macromind Director movie. That's my job.",3,2
M2,really [UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,yes,2,2
M2,"Wow, wow, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], wow.",3,1
M1,whole job constituted it,2,3
M2,"movie or is it a movie like the interface in action, what's it?",3,3
M1,"I can't tell you, that's a secret.",2,2
M2,"oh, hehe hehe hehe hehe laughed.",2,1
M1,But you know I'm going to have to put Quicktime stuff in,3,3
M2,yes,2,2
M1,and you they didn't want to put that speech,3,3
M2,Right.,3,1
M1,"So they can do speech recognition. I'm unintelligible, something about a touch screen. It's going to have and it's going to be on a touch screen.",2,3
M2,m: [EXCITED],4,1
M1,first thing you touch screen,3,3
M2,"I'm sorry, there seems to be no actual speech in the given line. The output should be [UNINTELLIGIBLE].",1,1
M1,"So I have to design, like a problem space, interface, you know.",3,3
M2,Right,3,2
M1,operator every time they push a button,2,3
M2,Right,3,2
M1,changes the problem space to a different state.,3,5
M2,Right up.,3,1
M1,and so I have to do a task analysis basically of the demo that I'm going to set up.,3,3
M2,[Static],3,1
M1,It's kind of not really necessarily a working thing.,2,2
M2,"you know, yeah",2,1
M1,"This guy and I were talking, and he goes to the local, um, and I say to him I go to the local, and actually, this is weird, yeah I was talking to a guy at-, and I (pause) and I, uh, go to the local, and uh, there's these, like, computer human interaction meetings.",3,4
M2,yeah (interjection),2,1
M1,the man took it.,2,4
M2,"right -> I'm sure, yeah",3,2
M1,I was talking to a guy who does research at one of the universities here. And he was talking about this machine that's a software program that's really doing good for finite state modeling.,3,4
M2,"had this, [!] (unintelligible breaths)",2,1
M1,"he says, you know we use that for you for human-computer interaction designing, you know, it's for models that can be described in a finite way.",3,4
M2,Silence. Static. Silence.,2,1
M1,I'm thinking finite state machine isn't like the problem space.,2,3
M2,"yes, he [NOISE]",2,2
M1,I come up and I ask him.,3,3
M2,Silence,2,1
M1,you know but he says and he's,2,2
M2,silence,2,1
M1,"Going on and on, you know.",3,2
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,"my students don't know anything about this, and they can't use it. And I'm thinking, isn't this a problem? And there's no way they'd understand this.",3,4
M2,"huh huh, heheh heheh heheh",2,1
M1,"So, I go up and I ask him after.",3,3
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,"he isn't this just problem space, stuff and he said yeah and I said well you know so why what's the problem then don't they all learn this in class.",3,3
M2,"UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNINTELLIGIBLE",2,1
M1,"he said, no psychologist knows that.",2,2
M2,"he, hhh hhh, hhh hhh hhh, hhh.",2,1
M1,talking about every psychologist,3,2
M2,on only at hhh CMU,2,2
M1,"yes, heh yes so [UNINTELLIGIBLE], one of those CMU [!] things",3,2
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],3,2
M1,Totally: [!],2,1
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,"human-computer interaction is essentially what it is, they analyze tasks.",2,3
M2,mhm.,2,1
M1,and then they wrote down the statistics and the operators on pieces of paper.,2,3
M2,mhm (affirmative sound),2,1
M1,"and then they find someone and they say you know, here's the state, here's the operator, go through the station. and they find the places where they have impasses. and they fix them. That's it",3,4
M2,"right, up",2,1
M1,that's about the total of it.,2,2
M2,Right.,2,1
M1,"They don't even do analysis, they just don't try to find out what you know.",3,3
M2,right,2,2
M1,"they don't even do that yet, so I'm saying that they were going to have to do that.",3,4
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,"you know, as a psychologist, I'm building up my own skills.",3,3
M2,right up,3,2
M1,a degree,2,2
M2,Right,3,2
M1,"that's my job, I play around with Macromedia Director",3,3
M2,it's fun going up,3,2
M1,We'll I just started this week,3,3
M2,yes,2,2
M1,"they wanted me to read some reports, of the focus groups and subjects you know, with huh.",3,3
M2,Yes,2,2
M1,watch some videos and write down the functions I'm gonna,3,3
M2,yes (nodding in agreement),3,2
M1,"just tell them that you are just macromind's director, but it's complicated",3,4
M2,that's what I've heard [exclamation mark],3,2
M1,"they even have like you know, they even have stuff where you can write C code, and that you can create an object and then have port and use that inside Macromind Director, so I might have to learn C++.",3,4
M2,yuck,2,1
M1,"you told them you know, I said look hhh [!] (0.2) you know hhh I don't know how to program in C plus plus hhh so if you have me do that hhh",3,3
M2,yes,3,2
M1,you better know that I don't know how to do that,2,2
M2,"Yes, ah, yeah.",2,1

M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,it's all the same,2,1
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1

M2,yes,2,2
M1,They don't know,2,3
M2,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],1,2

M1,"so, um, he kind of like, did you ever finish your thesis?",3,3
M2,"I finished, yeah.",3,2
M1,[UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M2,sort of,2,1
M1,Sort of [unintelligible],2,1
M2,"I finished it, but I haven't uploaded it yet.",3,3
M1,written it up for public.,3,3
M2,"It's written yeah, it's written. I haven't handed in the actual.",2,2
M1,Oh.,2,1
M2,zero exes of it to the static to the um- like private people you know,2,1
M1,Oh.,2,1
M2,like he,2,1
M1,"you did have it in them, they signed all the right",3,4
M2,"Yes, yes",2,2
M1,okay so that means you don't have to pay anymore,3,4

M2,ah-ha (laughter),2,1
M1,yes and he said that he was going to read it,2,3
M2,great [exclamation mark],3,2
M1,and told me what they cut out,3,3
M2,yes [UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,2
M1,it's a bit long [exclamation],3,2
M2,how long,2,2
M1,Silence (static noise) [UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M2,holy mackerel,2,1

M2,"yes, [static] → yeah.",3,1
M1,good to know,3,2
M2,"I just saw Sean Verace:ra defending on Monday, his.",3,3

M2,"about one hundred and fifty pages, or around that number.",2,4
M1,That's pretty big [exclamation].,3,2

M1,he shouldn't have made it look that way then.,3,3
M2,huh huh huh huh,2,1
M1,Who cares,1,1

I am (unintelligible) m

This second interpretation is possible due to the presence of ""(m)"" in the original, but it requires making an assumption about the ""m"" being part of a word and not a separate markup.

M1,you don't know how much (but).,3,2
M2,we'll probably get as much as they can give us.,3,3
M1,yes,2,1
M2,cause priority scores are so high.,3,3
M1,yes,2,2
M2,but you're them,3,2
M1,Until Newt gets a hold of it.,2,3
M2,"right, that's one thing actually",2,2

M2,"other thing isn't voted until now, but since it wasn't, they're in the next fiscal year.",2,4
M1,oh.,2,2
M2,"they don't have to find us until the following fiscal year, or you know something bureaucratic like that.",2,3

M2,"I'm afraid it seems like there are exclamation marks and special characters that don't represent speech in the provided line. To clean it, I would remove those elements as they don't contribute to understanding the spoken sentence:

+≈ hh hhh hhh hhh hh hh ∙hhh

After removing the non-speech symbols and markup, the cleaned sentence becomes:

hh hhh hhh hhh hh hh

Unfortunately, this line contains only ""h"" sounds repeated multiple times, which doesn't translate into a meaningful spoken sentence in English. So the output remains as:

M2,I thought about that.,3,2
M1,only apply to one place,2,3
M2,"I thought about that, definitely.",3,2
M1,"so, you know, making Macroindie Director movies, it's not genius work.",2,4
M2,yes,2,2
M1,"they also hired me, I think one of the reasons they did so was because they were about the behavioral implications like.",4,4
M2,right,3,1
M1,they might be interested in me for those reasons.,4,4
M2,Yes,3,2

M1,This is what she did.,3,4

M1,"an ergonomics backgroup, a biomechanics design backgroup and a production backgroup.",3,3

M1,I can't remember.,2,2
M2,[Static] (no words spoken),2,1
M1,"They look at the surgeons, and this is really weird, you'd think it wouldn't be, but their surgical instruments are basically out of order and they haven't changed for a hundred and fifty years. And so, they're using one like...you know one of the examples she had that was really horrible, it was really disgusting. It was really disgraceful, [unintelligible] that's a needle holder, and you know they don't - they don't hold the needles with their hands, they hold (a pause) hh.",3,4

M2,mhm (nodding sound),3,2
M1,They don't put any fingers through either of the holes.,2,3
M2,what did they do?,2,2
M1,"they take the long handle, and they jam their little finger right above the hole, right above the loo::p, and they put their thumb along the small handle, don't put their thumb through the hole either. Then they take their index finger and extend it where the crew is.",2,4
M2,okay [?] up,2,2
M1,you know the screw that holds the two parts,3,3
M2,right went yeah,2,2
M1,they kind of like guide the whole thing with their index finger and they sort of hold it like a gun.,2,4
M2,"I see, yeah okay, not now.",2,2
M1,Yeah,2,1
M2,"yes, okay",3,2
M1,"with their index finger, sticks out and that's how, but of course because of the shape of the thing. They also turn their writsts like.",2,2

M2,mhm (nodding affirmation),3,1
M1,"From that, she selected three hundred and forty frames.",2,4
M2,mhm (affirmative noise),2,2
M1,that best represented that gave her good shots,3,2
M2,mhm,2,1
M1,"she then did for thirty-six instruments, generally for surgical ones. She decided to redesign them. Because they were originally barbers, barbers were surgeons.",2,4
M2,"right, that's right [!] (exclamation mark removed)",3,1
M1,Oh:h,3,1
M2,yeah [UNINTELLIGIBLE],3,2

M1,there is no good reason reasons are people are,3,3
M2,Yes [exclamation mark],2,1
M1,that's the reason no one has done it before.,3,3
M2,yes,2,2
M1,she did prototype-like for the need-le holder pointing up.,3,3
M2,"ah, up",2,2
M1,"she did a fortified prototype of that, using a pen and paper prototype, where she",3,3
M2,right static.,2,1
M1,"she analyzed all hand movements, as a function of ergonomicists have this little known biometrical data, and then drew all hand movements on it.",3,4
M2,mhm,2,1
M1,"for each prototype, she was well, for each class of prototype",3,3
M2,right upward,2,1
M1,she did (0.3) a paper prototype and picked up (off) them just (how) you would hold it.,3,3
M2,Right.,2,1
M1,"she and coordinate space so that you could see you, then she did plastic prototypes, then she did metal prototypes, and she had the surgeons. You know, pick and of course the metal prototypes are designed, based, and so the surgeons tried those out and they said hhh yeah this is great hhh you know hhh let's. So then she goes to a manufacturer to analyze how.",3,4
M2,mhm,2,1
M1,"and this is how they do it they have molds, and they pour the gunk into it then they take it out of molds, and they have these, and bending all the pieces by hand.",3,4
M2,mhm,2,1
M1,"okay, so it's basically a hand job handcrafted.",2,4
M2,mhm,2,1
M1,"She redesigns the production process, using strips of metal instead.",3,4
M2,mhm.,2,1
M1,"that can be identified, (0.5) you know, by a machine rather",2,2
M2,Right,3,2
M1,"and since she's using cutting strips of metal off, you know you can polish them and stuff, you don't need to.",3,3
M2,yes,2,2
M1,"she redesigns the whole production process for each of her, and then they're kind of like the companies were, and she left England.",3,4
M2,Oh!,2,1
M1,silence,2,1
M2,[Silence (0.4)],2,1
M1,"she was done, so she left.",2,2
M2,"Right, yeah.",2,2
M1,"she also did this, the same thing, for like other domains. She measured people from Brazil, and the size, the weight, she did about five hundred pairs of feet.",3,4
M2,"okay (0.7) - The colon implies a slight elongation of the word ""okay"". So, the cleaned sentence is: Okay.",2,2
M1,"stations. She designed and built her own measuring station, which had thirty different stations.",2,4
M2,"he, huh [laughter].",2,1
M1,Kay.,2,1
M2,laughter he,2,1
M1,"she also took footprints, like you know, on and she had to design her own plastic, (0.3) rubber.",3,4
M2,right,2,2
M1,"she mapped all of that out and then she went to some factory and redesigned their shoe, you know their leather cutting process so that they would save more.",3,4
M2,silent [UNINTELLIGIBLE],2,1
M1,and they would use less leather.,2,3
M2,"""mhm, m:mm"" or ""mhm, mumbling""",2,1
